        <h2><u>What is this Website?</u></h2>
        <p>You may be asking yourself, what is this website and what's it all about? Well, for all you curious people, I shall explain everything to you. 
        This website is a wiki, or a database, based off the 'DooM' video game franchise developed by id Software and published by Bethesda Studios, although they only published two games in the franchise, DooM 3 and DOOM. The main purpose of this site is to encourage people to play DooM and become 'fans' of the game. This site has tried to reach this goal by outlining the plot of the game, some features that makes it what it is, is it really worth getting into, and more!</p>
              
        <p>Of course, the site is for many others, rather than just newcomers or curious people. If you're a returning fan that wants to pass the time or stay informed about the game and what's to come, the this site is for you as well! Everytime something new is dicovered, upcoming updates or brand new content, we'll be right here updating everything for your benefit.</p>
